## Installation

Some of you will see the warning in the screenshot below about the app "can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer" when you first try to run it.

</p>

This is because I am not registered with Apple as part of their developer program. This is the first MacOS app that I've ever built, and I don't plan to release it in the Mac App Store so I don't want to pay the fees to register with Apple.

To bypass Apple's restriction, right-click the app and select **"Open"** the first time you use it or open your System Preferences application, click on the Security & Privacy selection, and there will be an **"Open Anyway"** button you can click.
